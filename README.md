# Project 1 overview

I've been tasked with going through multiple files and an sqlite database to study the information and return informed reccomendations to microsofts new movie studio. I've made 3 reccomendations based on genres, profit, and average rating of directors.

The data was given to me in the form of .csv and .tsv files, as well as an sqlite database. The data contains movie names, ratings, budgets, domestic and foreign gross numbers. The sqlite database from IMDB is the most complete, although only recent until 2018

Plots generated:

## Conclusions

The three reccomendation I made were:
1. To make a movie that falls within these 4 genres: Action, Adventure, SciFi, Comedy.
2. To have a target budget of $43,000,000.
3. To select directors from the list I generated.
