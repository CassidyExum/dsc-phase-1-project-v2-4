# Project 1 overview

I've been tasked with going through multiple files and an sqlite database to study the information and return informed reccomendations to microsofts new movie studio. I've made 3 reccomendations based on genres, profit, and average rating of directors.

The data was given to me in the form of .csv and .tsv files, as well as an sqlite database. The data contains movie names, ratings, budgets, domestic and foreign gross numbers. The sqlite database from IMDB is the most complete, although only recent until 2018

The key files within this repository will be the code in student.ipynb and the presentation titled 'Microsoft Studios Movie Recommendations.'

Plots generated (plots may not be visable in dark mode. All relevent plots are included in the slides and visable clearly there):
